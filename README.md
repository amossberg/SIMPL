(IN PROGRESS)

This repository will provide a variety of simple programs and modules in Crestron's SIMPL language that demonstrate how to carry out basic automation tasks. We may add examples in SIMPL+ as well.  For SIMPL#, there are a number of helpful repositories available in Github which we will add links for.
